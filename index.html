      Some stories aren’t meant to be found — not yet. They’re written in moments when no one is watching, buried in silence, scattered between fragments of thoughts never spoken aloud. They’re not confessions. Not cries for attention. They are maps — drawn in the dark, by someone who was just trying to understand the shape of their own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you found this… maybe it wasn’t meant to be hidden from you. But even so, let me say this: I never meant to pull you into my depths. Not like this. What you’ve seen here is not a trap, nor a performance. It’s a quiet corner of me — one that was never asking to be exposed, just… stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if it feels too much, too strange, or too close — I understand. Truly. You were never meant to carry any of this. But if you chose to read… and if some part of it echoed in you, Then thank you. Not for understanding me — but for not turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even silence has weight, And sometimes… it’s heard only by the ones who were never supposed to hear it. So, if my silence reached you — I’m sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know I spent a lot of your time searching for an account, I know I won't let you see what's inside, But I’m also… thankful.
